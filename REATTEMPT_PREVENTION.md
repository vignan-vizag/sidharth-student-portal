# Test Re-attempt Prevention Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive restrictions to prevent students from re-attempting tests they have already completed, ensuring test integrity and fairness.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Assessment Page Protection** (`src/pages/assessment/[slug].tsx`)
- **Pre-Access Check**: Before showing the test start form, checks if student has already completed the test
- **Blocked Access Message**: Shows a clear warning message with navigation options if test is already completed
- **Start Test Confirmation**: Added a confirmation dialog with strong warnings about the no-retake policy
- **Visual Warnings**: Added warning banners and modified button text to emphasize the one-time nature

### 2. **Enhanced Dashboard** (`src/pages/dashboard.tsx`)
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual distinction between "Take Assessment" and "View Report" for completed tests
- **Download Report**: Maintained existing PDF download functionality for completed tests
- **Re-attempt Restriction Notice**: Added "🔒 Re-attempts not allowed" indicator for completed tests

### 3. **Public Assessment Lists** (`src/pages/assessment/index.tsx` & `src/pages/index.tsx`)
- **Status Badges**: Shows completion status with colored badges (✓ Completed, ⏳ Assigned, 📋 Available)
- **Conditional Buttons**: Different button text and styling based on completion status
- **Clear Messaging**: "Re-attempts not allowed" text for completed tests

### 4. **Backend Integration Safeguards** (`src/components/Hooks/useAssessment.tsx`)
- **Pre-Start Validation**: Checks completion status before allowing test start
- **State Management**: Proper handling of test completion states
- **Error Prevention**: Prevents accidental starts of completed tests

### 5. **User Experience Enhancements**
- **Confirmation Dialog** (`src/components/Elements/TestStartConfirmation.tsx`): Modal confirmation with strong warnings
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Color-coded status indicators throughout the application
- **Clear Messaging**: Consistent messaging about the one-attempt policy

## Technical Implementation

### Status Checking Logic
```typescript
const currentAssignedTest = studentInfo?.assignedTests.find(
  (assignedTest) => assignedTest.testId === test._id
);

if (currentAssignedTest?.status === 'completed') {
  // Block access and show appropriate message
}
```

### UI Status Indicators
- **Completed Tests**: Green theme with checkmark icons
- **Available Tests**: Blue theme for taking assessments
- **Assigned Tests**: Orange theme for pending tests

### Security Measures
1. **Multiple Check Points**: Validation at UI level, hook level, and before API calls
2. **State Consistency**: Proper state management to reflect completion status
3. **User Feedback**: Clear messaging and visual cues throughout the user journey

## User Flow Protection

### Before Implementation
1. Student could access any test page regardless of completion status
2. No clear indication of completion status on public pages
3. Potential for accidental re-attempts

### After Implementation
1. **Step 1**: Status check on all test listing pages
2. **Step 2**: Blocked access to completed tests with clear messaging
3. **Step 3**: Confirmation dialog for starting new tests
4. **Step 4**: Backend validation before test initiation
5. **Step 5**: Clear post-completion indicators and actions

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/assessment/[slug].tsx` - Main assessment page with access restrictions
- `src/pages/dashboard.tsx` - Enhanced dashboard with status indicators
- `src/pages/assessment/index.tsx` - Public assessment list with status badges
- `src/pages/index.tsx` - Home page test list with status badges
- `src/components/Hooks/useAssessment.tsx` - Backend integration safeguards
- `src/components/Elements/TestStartConfirmation.tsx` - New confirmation dialog component

## Benefits
1. **Test Integrity**: Prevents multiple attempts that could compromise assessment validity
2. **Fair Assessment**: Ensures all students have equal opportunity (one attempt each)
3. **Clear Communication**: Students understand the policy through consistent messaging
4. **Better UX**: Clear status indicators and appropriate actions for each test state
5. **Robust Implementation**: Multiple layers of protection against accidental re-attempts
